# Cause-effect Study

 This project  contains the files needed to replicate all the elements (hardware/software) used to conduct an experiment to know the effect of mobility
 on cognitive skills in children with cerebral palsy. 

 Three main components are needed in this project:
 1) Platform (Explorer) that can be attached to a manual wheelchair and that can be operated by an adapted push button.
 2) A hardware that allows collecting data from typical cause-effect therapy programs. It consists of an Arduino-based switch-contrelled circuit that can control how long a video is played on a computer screen.
 3) A mobile application that allows controlling both hardware and collecting data for analysis.
